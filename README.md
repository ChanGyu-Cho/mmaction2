# üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Golf Action Analysis API with STGCN (Based on mmaction2)

This repository details the modifications and deployment steps for a custom action recognition project, forked from OpenMMLab's **mmaction2**. We specifically leveraged the **STGCN (Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks)** model and fine-tuned it for precise golf swing analysis. The final, optimized model is packaged and served as a scalable RESTful API using **Docker** for standardized deployment.

## üöÄ Key Project Customizations

- **Framework Adaptation:** Forked and extensively modified the `mmaction2` codebase to integrate custom data loaders, configs, and training scripts specific to golf action sequences.
- **Model Fine-tuning:** Applied transfer learning to the STGCN architecture using a dedicated golf action dataset. Transfer learned inference is a binary classification of true or false.
- **Containerization (Docker):** Created a comprehensive deployment environment using a custom `Dockerfile`, ensuring all dependencies (PyTorch, mmaction2, etc.) and the fine-tuned model checkpoint are encapsulated.
- **API Server Implementation:** Developed a robust RESTful API layer (e.g., using FastAPI) within the Docker container to handle keypoint data submissions and return classification or localization results.
